# Pyke [![Project Status](http://githubkanban.herokuapp.com/images/mlowen_Pyke.png)](http://bit.ly/18OhrcL)
Pyke is a python build tool which is designed to be simple to use and configure, which also allows you to use the full power of python in your build scripts.

## Installation

To install pyke you need to have a package that supplies easy\_install installed (personally I use [distribute](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute/)).  Once you have easy\_install  and a copy of the source code you can install pyke by running the following command from the source:

`python setup.py install`

## Usage

`pyke [-h] [-t target [target ...]] [-f file] [-v] [-l] [-c] [-a] [-j] [-d] [-r]`

### Arguments:

When running pyke all arguments are optional.

* `-h, --help` show this help message and exit
* `-t target [target ...], --targets target [target ...]` Targets to build, default target is 'default'
* `-f file, --file file` The build file to load, default file name is 'build.pyke'
* `-v, --version` Displays version information
* `-l, --list` Lists all of the available targets in the build file.
* `-a, --all` Run build/clean against all targets in the build file.
* `-c, --clean` Remove all build artifacts generated when the target is built.
* `-d, --dependencies` Generate and store the dependencies for the source files in the target.
* `-r, --rebuild` Runs a clean followed by a build on the specified targets.
* `-b, --builders` List the available builders that can be used.

## Pyke File
A pyke build file for all intents and purposes is a python script, anything you can do in a python script can be done in a pyke script.  A build (including pre & post build methods) are run from the directory that the build file is located in which will be referred to as the base path in this section.

### Targets

A target in Pyke is a python method which returns a dictionary object, this object is used to decide what and how to build the target, the values that will be acted upon are as follows:

* `source_paths` This can either be a string or an array of strings, this field is used to specify the folders where your source code is located.  It is important to note that pyke recurses through the directories listed.  If no value is supplied then the base path will be used.
* `source_patterns` This can either be a string or an array of strings, this field is used for matching what files should be compiled, the [glob syntax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) is used to match the files.
* `output_path` This can only be a string, this field is used to specify the directory where the output files will be compiled to, if no value is supplied then the base path will be used.  If this directory does not exist then it will be created.
* `output_name` This can only be a string, this field is used to specify the name (sans extension) of the executable that will be generated by building the target.  If no value is specified then the name of the base path will be used.
* `compiler_flags` This can be a string or an array of strings, this field contains a list of flags to pass to the compiler.
* `linker_flags` This can be a string or an array of strings, this field contains a list of flags to pass to the linker.
* `compiler` This is an optional string which tells pyke what compiler to use, currently the only supported compiler is 'g++'.
* `output_type` This tells pyke what sort of object to generate, the available options are 'executable', 'staticlib' and 'dynamiclib' if no output_type is specified then it will default to 'executable'.
* `dependencies` This is an array of strings which list the targets that this target is dependent on to build successfully.
* `is_phoney` When this is specified all other fields except `run` and `dependencies` are ignored, and none of the regular build functionality will be run. Pre &amp; Post build functionality will be run and any dependencies of the target will be run.
* `run` This field is only referenced when this specifies the method to run between the pre &amp; post build steps. 

When no target name is specified in the command line Pyke will try and run a target called `default` so it is always handy to have one of your targets named `default`.

### Pre &amp; Post Builds

The pre and post build functionality are again just python functions that are called at the appropriate times, they should take no parameters and any returns will be ignored.  The pre &amp; post build functionality follows the naming convention of pre builds are the target name with the prefix `pre_` and post builds are the target name with the prefix `post_` so the pre-build function for the default target would be `pre_default` and the for the post-build `post_default`

### Cleaning

Pyke has a basic built in clean target which deletes any artifacts generated during the build.  This can happen in a couple of ways when using the built-in functionality Pyke will delete the directory specified in the `output_path` variable from the dictionary generated from the target unless that directory is the same as the base path, in that case pyke will only delete the file that is specified in the `output_name` variable.  If you are not happy with how the default clean functionality works you can override it by specifying a clean function in the build file.  Clean functions follow the same naming convention as the pre &amp; post build functions do with the prefix for clean functions being `clean_`. It is important to note that regardless of which method of cleaning you use the intermediate files generated by the build which are stored in the .pyke directory of the base path will be deleted.

### Overwriting Conventions
There may be times when it is useful for multiple targets to share clean, pre &amp; post build functions, or you may just not like the convention that pyke uses in either case you are able to overwrite what functions are called with ones of your choosing.  To overwrite those functions you can specify the function or the names of the function in one of the following variables in the dictionary returned from the target.

* `prebuild` To overwrite the targets pre-build function.
* `postbuild` To overwrite the targets post-build function.
* `clean` To overwrite the targets clean function.

### Example Build File

Below is a trivial example of a imaginary project that links to two libraries.

```python
def pre_default():
	print('Running the pre-build')

def default():
	return {
		'output_path': 'bin',
		'output_name': 'example_name',
		'source_path': [ 'src' ],
		'source_patterns': [ '*.cc', '*.cpp' ],
		'compiler_flags': [ '-WALL', '-I', '..\\libs\\include' ],
		'linker_flags': [ 'L', '..\\libs', '-lexample-lib-a', '-lexample-lib-b' ]
	}

def post_default():
	print('Running the post-build')
```

## Dependencies

Pyke currently has very naive dependency checking/generation, this is not done at compile-time and must be run separately.  The results from the dependency generation are stored in the .pyke file, an example of running the dependency generation is as follows:

`pyke --dependencies`

For C++ projects the dependency generator will only go two layers deep, it will extract the local headers in the source files and any other local headers those first headers may contain.

## To Do

The following is the list of features that are to be incorporated into Pyke and the approximate order in which they will be done.

* Expand to other compilers.
* Add a plugin system to allow others to write builders for compilers.
* Add the ability to embed the compile and link steps in the build file itself.
